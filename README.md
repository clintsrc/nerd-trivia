# Nerd Trivia

## Description

Play a quiz game to test your trivia knowledge!

- Trivia games are a great way to test your knowledge competetively against other players, and a way to know more about video games than when you started and have fun along the way.

- Creating the Nerd Trivia application provided a way to have hand-on experience as a team development a web application from the ground up using industry-standard tools. It was a fantastic challenge that allowed us to apply what we knew and to look beyond to find solutions we had not seen before.

- Working together on a team reveals how important planning and communication are to the success of a project. Not only is it critical to avoid conflicts with the work itself, but collaborative tools and iterative reviews are integral for shaping the direction of the application.
